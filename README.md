# Class_TRAINS
The seventh laboratory work in the first year of the Faculty of Mathematics of YarSU on the basics of programming in C++

Develop a class based on the description of the variant. Define methods for the class: constructor, destructor, copy 
constructor, data output, comparison, redefine assignment operator. The source data is at the user's choice (keyboard or file). 
To store data, use a vector. Provide for the possibility of editing list items — deleting, adding, changing. If no information is 
found during the search, display the corresponding message.

Describe a class named TRAIN containing the following fields: train number (int); destination name (string), departure 
time (string); list of intermediate stations (dynamic array string). Write a program that performs the following 
actions: — Data entry (file, keyboard of the user's choice). — Arrange entries by train numbers and destination name. 
— Display information about trains going to a given point. — Display information about trains that do not have intermediate stations.
